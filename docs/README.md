# SwitchTo
Provides the ability to bring a currently running application window to the foreground and 
optionally send keys to it.

<hr>

Many times when you are running a program such as a 'VMWare vSphere Client', and you have 
a corresponding open window such as a console window which you have minimized to the task 
bar, it cannot be easily restored.

This Microsoft Window's mini-application provides you with an easy, very 'fast' way to solve this 
problem:

Create a shortcut to the following application:
 
`%ProgramFiles(x86)%\SokoolTools\SwitchTo\SwitchTo.exe`
